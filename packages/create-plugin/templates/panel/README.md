# Grafana panel plugin template

This template is a starting point for building a panel plugin for Grafana.

## What are Grafana panel plugins?

Panel plugins allow you to add new types of visualizations to your dashboard, such as maps, clocks, pie charts, lists, and more.

Use panel plugins when you want to do things like visualize data returned by data source queries, navigate between dashboards, or control external systems (such as smart home devices).
