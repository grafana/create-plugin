## Deprecate a plugin

Grafana is maintained by a large community of engineers, SREs, and other professionals. The [Grafana plugin catalog](https://grafana.com/plugins/) contains a wide range of data source, panel, and app plugins - many of which are developed in open source by community members.

Itâ€™s not always possible for those developers to maintain plugins over time. Accordingly, Grafana Labs may de-list a plugin through deprecation if it does not meet our standards for security, quality and compatibility. Plugins may be deprecated for reasons including, but not limited to:

- A critical or high vulnerability is uncovered.
- The plugin is found to contain malicious code.
- The plugin is no longer compatible with any currently supported Grafana version.
- The plugin is showing no signs of maintenance - updates, responses to issues.
- For commercial plugins, where the agreement with said partner has lapsed or is no longer valid.
