# Migrate plugins from Grafana version 10.x to 11.x 

Follow these instructions to migrate plugins from Grafana version 10.x to 11.x 

## The vector type has been removed

In 10.0, DataFrame vectors were replaced with simple arrays.  See https://grafana.com/developers/plugin-tools/migration-guides/update-from-grafana-versions/migrate-9_x-to-10_x#data-frame-field-values-are-now-just-arrays  In 11.x, the vector type
has been removed.  Plugins that access data using get/set will continue to work, however plugins
that explicitly implement Vector will no longer work in grafana 11.  Update your plugin to use 
arrays and the code will run in both 10 and 11+.
