# Work with frontend components

Develop the frontend component of a Grafana plugin in Typescript with ReactJS as the View library. Several commands are available within the `plugin` directory for interacting with the frontend.

We [do not support](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/angular_deprecation/) plugins written in Angular.

## Frontend CLI reference

You can run the following commands when developing your plugin:

<CodeSnippets
  snippets={[
    { component: FrontendCLInpm, label: 'npm' },

    { component: FrontendCLIYarn, label: 'yarn' },
  ]}
  groupId="frontend-cli"
