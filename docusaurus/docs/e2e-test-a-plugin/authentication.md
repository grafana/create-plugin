## Introduction

To be able to interact with the Grafana UI, you need to be logged in to Grafana. `@grafana/plugin-e2e` provides a declarative way to handle authentication and creating users that can be used to test role-based access control (RBAC) in your plugin.

### Plugins that don't use RBAC

If your plugin doesn't use RBAC, you can use the default server administrator credentials to login. The following snippet is a [setup project](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-global-setup-teardown#setup-example) that invokes a function in the `@grafana/plugin-e2e` package that will login to Grafana using `admin:admin`. The authenticated state is stored on disk and the file name pattern is as follows: `<plugin-root>/playwright/.auth/<username>.json`.

```ts
// playwright.config.js|ts
projects: [
  {
    name: 'auth',
    testDir: 'node_modules/@grafana/plugin-e2e/dist/auth',
    testMatch: [/.*\.js/],
  },
];
```

The next project we add will run all tests in the `./tests` directory. We're reusing the authentication state from the `auth` project that we just added. This means login will only happen once, and all tests in the `run-tests` project will start already authenticated.

```ts
projects: [
  {
    name: 'auth',
    testDir: 'node_modules/@grafana/plugin-e2e/dist/auth',
    testMatch: [/.*\.js/],
  },
  {
    name: 'run-tests',
    testDir: './tests',
    use: {
      ...devices['Desktop Chrome'],
      storageState: 'playwright/.auth/admin.json',
    },
    dependencies: ['auth'],
  },
];
```

### Plugins that use RBAC

If your plugin uses RBAC, you may want to write tests that verify that certain plugin features are role-based. `@grafana/plugin-e2e` lets you define users with roles in the playwright config file. In the following example, a new user with the role `Viewer` is created in the `createViewerUserAndAuthenticate` setup project. In the next project, authentication state for the user with the viewer role is reused when running the tests. Note that tests that are specific for the `Viewer` role have been added to a dedicated `testDir`.

```ts title="playwright.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';
import type { PluginOptions } from '@grafana/plugin-e2e';

export default defineConfig<PluginOptions>({
  ...
  projects: [
      {
        name: 'createViewerUserAndAuthenticate',
        testDir: 'node_modules/@grafana/plugin-e2e/dist/auth',
        testMatch: [/.*auth\.setup\.ts/],
        use: {
          user: {
            user: 'viewer',
            password: 'password',
            role: 'Viewer',
          },
        },
      },
      {
        name: 'run-tests-for-viewer',
        testDir: './tests/viewer',
        use: {
          ...devices['Desktop Chrome'],
          storageState: 'playwright/.auth/viewer.json',
        },
        dependencies: ['createViewerUserAndAuthenticate'],
      },
  ]
})
```
