# Get started

This article will guide through how to install and configure `@grafana/plugin-e2e`, write tests and setup a basic Github workflow that can run your end-to-end tests targeting multiple versions of Grafana.

:::warning
`@grafana/plugin-e2e` is still in beta and subject to breaking changes.
:::

## Prerequisites

- You need to have a Grafana plugin [development environment](https://grafana.com/developers/plugin-tools/get-started/set-up-development-environment)
- Node.js 18+
- Basic Knowledge of Playwright. If you have not worked with Playwright before, we recommend following the [Getting started](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) section in their documentation

### Installing Playwright

Please refer to the [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#installing-playwright) for instruction on how to install. `@grafana/plugin-e2e` extends Playwright APIs, so you need to have `Playwright/test` with a minimum version of 0.40.0 installed as a dev dependency in the package.json file of your plugin.

You can remove any test files (`[filename].spec.js|ts`) that was generated when you installed Playwright. Let's also add the following line to your `.gitignore` file.

```shell title=".gitignore"
/playwright/.auth/
```

## Set up `plugin-e2e`

Optional: If you would like to follow along with our example tests, use the [create-plugin](../get-started/get-started.mdx) tool to generate a backend data source plugin.

<CodeSnippets
snippets={[
{ component: ScaffoldPluginE2ECreateDSPluginNPM, label: 'npm' },
{ component: ScaffoldPluginE2ECreateDSPluginYarn, label: 'yarn' },
{ component: ScaffoldPluginE2ECreateDSPluginPNPM, label: 'pnpm' }
]}
groupId="package-manager"
queryString="current-package-manager"
/>

### Step 1: Installing `@grafana/plugin-e2e`

Now open the terminal and run the following command in your plugin's project directory:

<CodeSnippets
snippets={[
{ component: ScaffoldPluginE2InstallNPM, label: 'npm' },
{ component: ScaffoldPluginE2EInstallYarn, label: 'yarn' },
{ component: ScaffoldPluginE2EInstallPNPM, label: 'pnpm' }
]}
groupId="package-manager"
queryString="current-package-manager"
/>

### Step 2: Configure Playwright

Open the Playwright config file that was generated when Playwright was installed.

1. Uncomment `baseUrl` and change it to `'http://localhost:3000'`.

```ts title="playwright.config.ts"
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
```

2. Playwright uses [projects](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-projects) to logically group tests that have the same configuration. We're going to add two projects:

   1. `auth` is a setup project will login to Grafana and store the authenticated state on disk.
   2. `run-tests` runs all the tests in a browser of choice. By adding a dependency to the `auth` project we ensure login only happens once, and all tests in the `run-tests` project will start already authenticated.

   Your Playwright config should have the following project configuration:

```ts title="playwright.config.ts"
import { dirname } from 'path';
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

const pluginE2eAuth = `${dirname(require.resolve('@grafana/plugin-e2e'))}/auth`;

export default defineConfig({
    ...
    projects: [
    {
      name: 'auth',
      testDir: pluginE2eAuth,
      testMatch: [/.*\.js/],
    },
    {
      name: 'run-tests',
      use: {
        ...devices['Desktop Chrome'],
        storageState: 'playwright/.auth/admin.json',
      },
      dependencies: ['auth'],
    }
  ],
});
```

### Step 3: Start Grafana

Next, start up the latest version of Grafana on your local machine.

<CodeSnippets
snippets={[
{ component: ScaffoldPluginE2EStartGrafanaNPM, label: 'npm' },
{ component: ScaffoldPluginE2EStartGrafanaYarn, label: 'yarn' },
{ component: ScaffoldPluginE2EStartGrafanaPNPM, label: 'pnpm' }
]}
groupId="package-manager"
queryString="current-package-manager"
/>

If you want to start a specific version of Grafana, you can do that by specifying the `GRAFANA_VERSION` environment variable.

```bash
GRAFANA_VERSION=10.1.6 npm run server
```

### Step 4: Write tests

You are now ready to write your tests. In this example, we're using the panel edit page to test the query editor for a backend data source plugin. The plugin was scaffolded with the [create-plugin](../get-started/get-started.mdx) tool, and for this data source the query endpoint returns hard coded data points. This test asserts that the values `1` and `3` are being displayed in the `Table` panel.

```ts title="queryEditor.spec.ts"
import { test, expect } from '@grafana/plugin-e2e';

test('data query should return values 1 and 3', async ({ panelEditPage, readProvisionedDataSource }) => {
  const ds = await readProvisionedDataSource({ fileName: 'datasources.yml' });
  await panelEditPage.datasource.set(ds.name);
  await panelEditPage.setVisualization('Table');
  await expect(panelEditPage.refreshPanel()).toBeOK();
  await expect(panelEditPage.panel.data).toContainText(['1', '3']);
});
```

### Step 5: Run tests

Open a new terminal and run the test script from within your local plugin development directory.

<CodeSnippets
snippets={[
{ component: ScaffoldPluginE2ERunTestsNPM, label: 'npm' },
{ component: ScaffoldPluginE2ERunTestsYarn, label: 'yarn' },
{ component: ScaffoldPluginE2ERunTestsPNPM, label: 'pnpm' }
]}
groupId="package-manager"
queryString="current-package-manager"
/>

### Step 6: Run tests in CI

We recommend using a CI workflow to run end-to-end tests to continuously check for breakages. The following Github workflow will run end-to-end tests against a range of Grafana versions for every PR in your Github repository. 

:::note 
This is a generic example based on a backend plugin. You may need to alter or remove some of the steps in the `playwright-tests` job before using it in your plugin.

{ component: ScaffoldPluginE2EDSWorkflowNPM, label: 'npm' },
{ component: ScaffoldPluginE2EDSWorkflowYarn, label: 'yarn' },
{ component: ScaffoldPluginE2EDSWorkflowPNPM, label: 'pnpm' }
]}
groupId="package-manager"
queryString="current-package-manager"
/>
