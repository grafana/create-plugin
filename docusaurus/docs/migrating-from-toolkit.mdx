title: Migrating from Grafana Toolkit
---

If you are using `@grafana/toolkit` to scaffold and develop plugins this guide will help you make the jump to plugin tools.

:::caution
We [do not support](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/angular_deprecation/) plugins written in Angular.
:::

## Why migrate?

- **More flexible:** With @grafana/create-plugin, developers have more control over their plugins, its dependencies, and can more easily customize the tooling to fit their specific needs.
- **Faster development time:** With its out-of-the-box development environment @grafana/create-plugin can significantly reduce development time compared to using @grafana/toolkit.
- **Improved testing capabilities:** Testing plugins with @grafana/create-plugin is much easier with github workflows that automate unit and e2e test runs whenever changes are pushed to github.
- **Better documentation:** The documentation for @grafana/create-plugin is more comprehensive and easier to discover than @grafana/toolkit.

:::warning
Before running the following command we strongly suggest backing up the code. Ideally, store the plugin code in a Git repository and run the command on a clean branch to easily identify changes made by the migration command.
:::

## Migrate your plugin to create-plugin

To get started, in the root directory of the existing plugin (where the `package.json` file is) run the following command and answer the prompts.

<CodeSnippets
  paths={[
    'createplugin-migrate.npm.shell.md',
    'createplugin-migrate.pnpm.shell.md',
    'createplugin-migrate.yarn.shell.md',
  ]}
  groupId="package-manager"
  queryString="current-package-manager"
/>

## Prompts

When running the migrate command the following prompts will appear asking for confirmation before making changes. Due to their destructive nature the default for each of the following prompts is `no`.

### The following files will be overriden. Would you like to continue?

Selecting `y` will create/replace the following files/folders in the plugin directory:

```
myplugin-directory/
├── .config/
├── .eslintrc
├── .nvmrc
├── .prettierrc.js
├── docker-compose.yaml
├── jest-setup.js
├── jest.config.js
└── tsconfig.json
```

### The following files are required. Can we scaffold them for you?

Selecting `y` will make sure a `CHANGELOG.md` file exists in the plugin directory.

### The following files are possibly not needed anymore. Are you ok with us removing them?

Selecting `y` will delete the following files/folders in the plugin directory:

```
myplugin-directory/
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
├── webpack/
├── .webpack/
└── .prettierrc
```

### Would you like to update the following dependencies in the package.json?

Selecting `y` will update all the npm dependencies listed by the prompt. The command purposely avoids updating `@grafana` npm dependencies to reduce the friction with migration.

### Would you like to remove the following possibly unnecessary NPM dependencies?

Selecting `y` will delete the following npm dependencies found in `package.json`:

```diff json
{
  "devDependencies": {
-   "ts-loader": "*",
-   "babel-loader": "*",
-   "@grafana/toolkit": "*"
  }
}
```

### Would you like to update the scripts in your package.json? All scripts using grafana-toolkit will be replaced.

This step will update any npm scripts in the `package.json` file to match the latest configurations. Any scripts that were previously using `grafana-toolkit` will be replaced.

## Next steps

When the migration command finishes running, look at the changes introduced and then install frontend dependencies followed by running each of the npm scripts inside `package.json` to confirm the plugin can be built, tested, signed etc.

If the plugin had customizations to the toolkit configs (e.g. webpack) head over to the [advanced configuration guide](./advanced-configuration.md) to learn how to update them.

If the plugin can be built but there are problems with jest tests see the [jest advanced configuration](advanced-configuration.md#esm-errors-with-jest) issue regarding es modules.
