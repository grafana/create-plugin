# App plugin methods

App plugins can use different methods on the `AppPlugin` instance to register extensions or to expose functionality.

```typescript
// module.tsx
export const plugin = new AppPlugin<{}>()
  .setRootPage(App)
  .addLink({ /* ... */ })
  .addLink({ /* ... */ })
  .addComponent({ /* ... */ })
  .exposeComponent({ /* ... */ })
```

## `.addLink(config)`

This method can be used to register a link extension to a certain extension point. Link extensions are used to add links to different parts of the Grafana UI or other plugins.

```typescript
.addLink({
    targets: ["grafana/dashboard/panel/menu"],
    title: "Declare incident",
    description: "Declare an incident and attach the panel context to it",
    path: "/a/myorg-incidents-app/incidents",
})
```

### Parameters

The `.addLink()` method takes a single `config` object with the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **`targets`** | A list of identifiers for the extension points you would like to extend. <br /> _E.g.: `"grafana/dashboard/panel/menu"`. [See available extension points in Grafana &rarr;](#available-extension-points-within-grafana)_ |
| **`title`** | A human readable title for the link. <br /> _E.g.: `"Declare incident"`_ |
| **`description`** | A human readable description for the link. <br /> _E.g.: `"Declare an incident and attach the panel context to it"`_ |
| **`path?`** | _(Optional)_ A path within your app plugin where you would like to send users when they click the link. <br /> _E.g.: `"/a/myorg-incidents-app/incidents"`_ |
| **`onClick?`** | _(Optional)_ A callback that should be triggered when the user clicks the link. (Use either `path` or `onClick`.) |
| **`category?`** | _(Optional)_ A category that should be used to group your link with other links. |
| **`icon?`** | _(Optional)_ An icon that should be used while displaying your link. <br /> _E.g.: `"edit"` or `"bookmark"`. [See all available icon names &rarr;](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/packages/grafana-data/src/types/icon.ts#L1)_|
| **`configure?`** | _(Optional)_ A function that is called prior to displaying the link which enables you to dynamically change or hide your link depending on its `context`. |

### Return value

The method returns the `AppPlugin` instance to allow for chaining.


### Examples


## `.addComponent(config)`

This method can be used to register a React component to a certain extension point to implement a new ui experience.

```typescript
.addComponent({
    targets: ["grafana/user/profile/tab"],
    title: "New user profile tab",
    description: "A new tab that shows extended user profile information",
    component: () => {
        return <div>Hello World!</div>;
    },
})
```

### Parameters

The `.addComponent()` method takes a single `config` object with the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **`targets`** | A list of identifiers for the extension points you would like to extend. <br /> _E.g.: `"grafana/dashboard/panel/menu"`. [See available extension points in Grafana &rarr;](#available-extension-points-within-grafana)_ |
| **`title`** | A human readable title for the component. |
| **`description`** | A human readable description for the component. |
| **`component`** | A React component that will be rendered by the extension point. It's up to each extension point to decide what props it is going to pass to the component when rendering. |

### Return value

The method returns the `AppPlugin` instance to allow for chaining.


### Examples


## `.exposeComponent(config)`

This method is exposing a React component and makes it available for other plugins to use.

```typescript
.exposeComponent({
    id: "myorg-incidents-app/create-incident-form",],
    title: "Create incident form",
    description: "A form to create a new incident.",
    component: () => {
        return <div>Hello World!</div>;
    },
})
```

### Parameters

The `.exposeComponent()` method takes a single `config` object with the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **`id`** | A unique string identifier of the component you are exposing. **It must be prefixed with your plugin ID.** <br /> _E.g.: `"myorg-incidents-app/create-incident-form"`._ |
| **`title`** | A human readable title for the component. |
| **`description`** | A human readable description for the component. |
| **`component`** | A React component that you are exposing. <br /> _Make sure to wrap it with the necessary React context providers that the component is relying on, as this component is not going to be rendered under the same React tree as your plugin._ |

### Return value

The method returns the `AppPlugin` instance to allow for chaining.
