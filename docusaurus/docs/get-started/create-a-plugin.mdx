import ScaffoldNPM from '@snippets/createplugin-scaffold.npm.md';
import ScaffoldPNPM from '@snippets/createplugin-scaffold.pnpm.md';
import ScaffoldYarn from '@snippets/createplugin-scaffold.yarn.md';

To create a new Grafana plugin, run the following command in your shell:

<CodeSnippets
  snippets={[
    { component: ScaffoldNPM, label: 'npm' },
    { component: ScaffoldPNPM, label: 'pnpm' },
    { component: ScaffoldYarn, label: 'yarn' },
  ]}
  groupId="package-manager"
  queryString="current-package-manager"
/>

:::info
When prompted, enter answers to the given questions. For example:

```
? What is going to be the name of your plugin?: _mongodb_
? What is the organization name of your plugin?: _grafana_
? What type of plugin would you like?: _datasource_
```

If you enter those values for name, organization, and plugin type, then the directory and plugin ID will be named `grafana-mongodb-datasource`.

## Prompts reference

When running the `create-plugin` command, the following prompts appear:

### What is the name of your plugin?

Enter the name of your plugin. This helps to identify its purpose.

### What is the organization name of your plugin?

Enter the name of your organization. Grafana plugins require an organization name (normally your [Grafana account](https://grafana.com/signup/) username) to help uniquely identify your plugin.

### How would you describe your plugin?

Give your plugin a description. This will help users more easily understand what it does when the plugin is distributed.

### What type of plugin would you like?

Select from the following choices:

- **app**: Create a custom out-of-the-box monitoring experience.
- **datasource**: Add support for new databases or external APIs.
- **panel**: Add new visualizations to dashboards.
- **scenesapp**: Create scenes applications or scenes plugins (that is, dashboard-like experiences in app plugins). Currently in public preview.

To learn more about the types of plugins, refer to the [plugin management guidelines](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/plugin-management/).
To learn more about scenes, refer to the [Scenes documentation](https://grafana.github.io/scenes/).

### Do you want a backend part of your plugin?

App and data source plugins can have a backend component written in Go. Backend plugins offer powerful features such as:

- Enable [Grafana Alerting](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/) for data sources.
- Connect to non-HTTP services to which a browser normally can’t connect. For example, SQL database servers.
- Keep state between users. For example, query caching for data sources.
- Use custom authentication methods and/or authorization checks that aren’t supported in Grafana.
- Use a custom data source request proxy. To learn more, refer to [Backend developer resources](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/plugins/backend/#resources).

### Do you want to add Github CI and Release workflows?

Add [github workflows](/plugin-tools/docs/create-a-plugin/set-up-github-workflows) to your development cycle to help catch issues early or release your plugin to the community.

### Do you want to add a Github workflow to automatically check Grafana API compatibility on PRs?

Add a [github workflow](/plugin-tools/docs/create-a-plugin/set-up-github-workflows#the-compatibility-check-is-compatibleyml) to regularly check that your plugin is compatible with the latest version of Grafana.
