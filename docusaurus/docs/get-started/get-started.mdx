Grafana's plugin tools offer an officially supported way to extend Grafana's core functionality. We have designed these tools to help you to develop your plugins faster with a modern build setup and zero configuration.

The plugin tools consist of two packages:

- `create-plugin`: A CLI to scaffold new plugins or migrate plugins created with `@grafana/toolkit`.
- `sign-plugin`: A CLI to sign plugins for distribution.

## Quick Start

To scaffold your plugin, follow these steps:

1. Run the following command:

  <CodeSnippets
    snippets={[
      { component: ScaffoldNPM, label: 'npm' },
      { component: ScaffoldPNPM, label: 'pnpm' },
      { component: ScaffoldYarn, label: 'yarn' },
    ]}
    groupId="package-manager"
    queryString="current-package-manager"
  />

1. When prompted, enter answers to the given questions. For example:

  ```
  ? What is going to be the name of your plugin?: _mongodb_
  ? What is the organization name of your plugin?: _grafana_
  ? What type of plugin would you like?: _datasource_
  ```

  If you enter those values for name, organization, and plugin type, then the directory and plugin ID will be named `grafana-mongodb-datasource`.

  :::note

  If you have previously built a plugin with `@grafana/toolkit`, you can use our plugin tools to simplify migration. For more information, refer to [Migrate from toolkit](/migration-guides/migrate-from-toolkit.mdx).

### Before you begin

Make sure you are using supported a supported OS, Grafana version, and tooling.

#### Supported operating systems

Grafana plugin tools work with the following operating systems:

- Linux
- macOS
- Windows 10+ with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

#### Supported Grafana version

We generally recommend that you build for a version of Grafana later than v9.0. For more information about requirements and dependencies when developing with Grafana, see the [Grafana developer's guide](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/contribute/developer-guide.md).

#### Recommended tooling

You'll need to have the following tools set up:

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) version 1.18 or above
- [Mage](https://magefile.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16 or above
- Optionally [Yarn 1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) or [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

#### Choose a package manager

When you first run `@grafana/create-plugin`, choose your package manager: `npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn`.

## Output

Run the above command to create a directory called `<orgName>-<pluginName>-<pluginType>` inside the current directory. This directory contains the initial project structure to kickstart your plugin development.

:::info

The directory name `<orgName>-<pluginName>-<pluginType>` is based on the answers you gave to the prompts. Use the name of the generated folder when prompted.

:::

Depending on the answers you gave to the prompts, there should now be a structure like:

```
<orgName>-<pluginName>-<pluginType>
├── .config/
├── .eslintrc
├── .github
│   └── workflows
├── .gitignore
├── .nvmrc
├── .prettierrc.js
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── LICENSE
├── Magefile.go
├── README.md
├── cypress
│   └── integration
├── docker-compose.yaml
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
├── jest-setup.js
├── jest.config.js
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── pkg
│   ├── main.go
│   └── plugin
├── src
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── components
│   ├── datasource.ts
│   ├── img
│   ├── module.ts
│   ├── plugin.json
│   └── types.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```

When you've finished installing the tools, open the plugin folder:

<CodeSnippets
  paths={[
    'createplugin-install.npm.shell.md',
    'createplugin-install.pnpm.shell.md',
    'createplugin-install.yarn.shell.md',
  ]}
  groupId="package-manager"
  queryString="current-package-manager"
/>

## Create-plugin prompts reference

When running the `create-plugin` command, the following prompts appear:

### What is the name of your plugin?

Enter the name of your plugin. This helps to identify its purpose.

### What is the organization name of your plugin?

Enter the name of your organization. Grafana plugins require an organization name (normally your [Grafana account](https://grafana.com/signup/) username) to help uniquely identify your plugin.

### How would you describe your plugin?

Give your plugin a description. This will help users more easily understand what it does when the plugin is distributed.

### What type of plugin would you like?

Select from the following choices:

- **app**: Create a custom out-of-the-box monitoring experience.
- **datasource**: Add support for new databases or external APIs.
- **panel**: Add new visualizations to dashboards.
- **scenesapp**: Create scenes applications or scenes plugins (that is, dashboard-like experiences in app plugins). Currently in public preview.

To learn more about the types of plugins, refer to the [plugin management guidelines](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/plugin-management/).
To learn more about scenes, refer to the [Scenes documentation](https://grafana.github.io/scenes/).

### Do you want a backend part of your plugin?

App and data source plugins can have a backend component written in Go. Backend plugins offer powerful features such as:

- Enable [Grafana Alerting](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/) for data sources.
- Connect to non-HTTP services to which a browser normally can’t connect. For example, SQL database servers.
- Keep state between users. For example, query caching for data sources.
- Use custom authentication methods and/or authorization checks that aren’t supported in Grafana.
- Use a custom data source request proxy. To learn more, refer to [Backend developer resources](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/plugins/backend/#resources).

### Do you want to add Github CI and Release workflows?

Add [Github workflows](/create-a-plugin/develop-a-plugin/set-up-github-workflows) to your development cycle to help catch issues early or release your plugin to the community.

### Do you want to add a Github workflow to automatically check Grafana API compatibility on PRs?

Add a [Github workflow](/create-a-plugin/develop-a-plugin/set-up-github-workflows#the-compatibility-check-is-compatibleyml) to regularly check that your plugin is compatible with the latest version of Grafana.

## Key CLI commands

After `create-plugin` has finished, you can run built-in commands in the shell:

### <SyncCommand cmd="run dev" />

Builds the plugin in _development mode_ and runs in _watch mode_. Rebuilds the plugin whenever you make changes to the code. You'll see build errors and lint warnings in the console.

### <SyncCommand cmd="run test" />

Runs the tests and watches for changes.

### <SyncCommand cmd="run build" />

Creates a production build of the plugin that optimizes for the best performance. Minifies the build and includes hashes in the filenames.

<h3>
  <code>mage -v</code>
</h3>

Builds backend plugin binaries for Linux, Windows and Darwin.
