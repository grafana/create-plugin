# Grafana plugin types and usage

Grafana plugin development allows for many options depending on the type of user experience you want to create. Make a plugin in one of several different types depending on whether you want to offer users a new way of visualizing data, a connection to a new database, or an integrated out-of-the-box experience.  

The following table shows the plugin types currently supported by Grafana on the frontend and backend. You can also see whether or not each type is supported by the [Grafana API](https://grafana.com/api/plugins).

|                |                 |                |                            |
| -------------- | :-------------: | :------------: | :------------------------: |
| **Type**       | **Frontend** |   **Backend**  | **SDK-supported** |
| datasource     |       Yes       | Yes (optional) |             Yes            |
| app            |       Yes       | Yes (optional) |             Yes            |
| panel          |       Yes       |       No       |             Yes            |
| renderer       |        No       |       Yes      |             No             |
| secretsmanager |        No       |       Yes      |             No             |

## Data source plugins

In plugin development, you can create new data source plugins to use Grafana with new databases, similar to existing plugins such as [MongoDB](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/grafana-mongodb-datasource/) or [Google BigQuery](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/grafana-bigquery-datasource/).

### Usage of data-source plugins

Create and configure a Grafana data source when you want to work with data provided by a third-party service for use in Grafana Dashboards, Explore, Alerting, and so on.

The data source API [(`/api/datasources`)](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/http_api/data_source/) exposes endpoints to create, read, update, and delete data sources.

Given any installed plugin of type `datasource`, you can create and configure any number of data sources per [Grafana organization](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/organization-management/#about-organizations). After you create zero to infinity data sources, they are persisted in Grafana's database. 

:::note

To distinguish a Grafana data source from a data-source plugin, we sometimes refer to the latter as a _data-source instance_, that is, a configured Grafana data source with a `plugin id` type of `datasource`.

:::


### Provisioning of data sources

Use the [Grafana configuration file](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-grafana/) to configure your data source plugins.

Data sources can also be provisioned using Grafana’s [provisioning features](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/provisioning/) so that you can use YAML files when Grafana starts up or on demand. Note that a plugin of type `datasource` must be installed before it can be provisioned.

### Bundling of dashboards

Data-source plugins can include dashboards by referencing dashboard JSON files (including `property` and `type=dashboard`) within the `plugin.json` file. Grafana puts a data source plugin in the `General` folder when it is imported.

## App plugins

Development of app plugins, also known as apps or applications, allows you to bundle data sources and panels to provide a seamless monitoring experience, similar to existing plugins such as [Zabbix](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/alexanderzobnin-zabbix-app/).

### Usage of apps

You can configure a Grafana app when you want to integrate with a third-party service and optionally provide custom pages and such within Grafana. Given any installed plugin of type `app`, you can enable them once per per [Grafana organization](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/organization-management/#about-organizations) and they are persisted in Grafana’s database. 

Use the plugin settings API [`/api/plugins`](https://grafana.com/api/plugins), `/api/plugins/\<plugin id\>/settings/`) for endpoints to read and update app settings. For example, you can enable or disable the app with your preferred configurations. 

:::note

To distinguish a Grafana app from an app plugin, we sometimes refer to the latter as an _app instance_, that is, a configured Grafana app with a `plugin id` type of `app`. 

::: 

### Provisioning of apps

Use the [Grafana configuration file](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-grafana/) to configure your app plugins.

Apps can also be provisioned using Grafana’s [provisioning features](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/provisioning/) so that you can use YAML files to start them when Grafana starts or on demand. Note that the plugin must be installed before provisioning can succeed with a `plugin id` of `app` type.

### Bundling of apps

The app plugin type allows you to [nest other plugins inside it](../create-a-plugin/extend-a-plugin/nested-plugins); in other words, to bundle or distribute multiple plugins in the same package. 

### Bundling of dashboards

App plugins can include dashboards by referencing dashboard JSON files within the `plugin.json` including `property` and `type=dashboard`. Grafana puts an app plugin in the `General` folder when it is imported.

## Panel (visualization) plugins

Development of panel plugins, also known as visualizations, allows Grafana to use custom visualizations, similar to existing plugins such the [Worldmap](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/grafana-worldmap-panel/) panel. 

### Usage of panel plugins

Any installed plugin of type `panel` can be used, selected, and configured as a visualization within a dashboard.

Use the plugins API ([`/api/plugins`](https://grafana.com/api/plugins), `/api/plugins/\<plugin id\>/`) for endpoints to retrieve installed plugins, including panel plugins. 

Compared with data sources and apps, there’s currently no support for configuring visualizations on a [Grafana organization](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/organization-management/#about-organizations) level. 

:::note

With the recent introduction of [Grafana Scenes](https://grafana.com/developers/scenes), you can use any installed plugin of type `panel` as a visualization within a Scenes implementation.

:::

### Provisioning of panels

Use the [Grafana configuration file](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-grafana/) to configure your app plugins.

## Server-side image rendering plugins

Rendering plugins allows the Grafana server to render images. Examples of plugins using image rendering include [Grafana Reporting](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/create-reports/) and [Grafana Alerting](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/). 

### Usage of rendering plugins

Grafana does not currently provide SDK support for implementing rendering plugins.

## Secrets management plugins

Plugins can also be used to manage encrypted fields to which only the backend server has access, such as API keys or certifications.

### Usage of secrets management plugins

Grafana does not currently provide SDK support for implementing secrets management plugins.
